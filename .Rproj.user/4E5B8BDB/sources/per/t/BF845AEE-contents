Load ML functions
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("ML_functions.R")
```

Read Sobol samples 
```{r}
sobol_samples = read.csv('Physicell_NLCs-CLL/data_output/Parameter_exploration/samples/Samples_0.csv')
viability = read.csv('Physicell_NLCs-CLL/data_output/Parameter_exploration/results/viability_1.csv')
```

Set data
```{r}
time_point = 1
data = sobol_samples %>%
  mutate(target = as.numeric(t(viability[time_point,])))
```

Set training and testing set
```{r}
index = createDataPartition(data[,"target"], times = 1, p = 0.8, list = FALSE) 
training_set = data[index,]
testing_set = data[-index,]
```
